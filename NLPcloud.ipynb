If the storage is done with “chemical” devices, we can use a battery or convert electricity into hydrogen, and if we use the means of mechanical energy, we can for example use water stored in altitude, in a dam lake.\n",

        "If all the electricity production in France was wind generated, storage in batteries would probably be impossible to ensure: to store one week of electricity consumption (which is over1 TWh per day for the whole country), the country should have 7 tons of lead-acid batteries (these batteries can store 30 Wh per kg) per French person (lead-acid batteries are not precisely perfectly “clean” regarding the environmental impact of their manufacturing and their end of life…).\n",
        "\n",
        "A probably more realistic solution would consist in producing hydrogen when there is wind (through electrolysis), then use it in fuel cells when there is no wind. The efficiency of electrolysis is 80% at best, that of storage is also 80% at best (there must be an energy spending to compress the hydrogen into a reservoir!), and then the best fuel cells have an efficiency of 80% in cogeneration (which means promoting electric heating, in a way!) but of 45% fort the sole electricity production.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this last case, the efficiency of the whole storage chain is 28%. If we suppose that half of the electricity is used when it is produced, but that the other half has to be stored, with an efficiency of 25%, then we need roughly 600,000 windmills of 1 MW to produce 500 TWh (that is 125.000 machines that produce without storage, and 500.000 that produce with storage, hence, with an efficiency divided by 4, the total representing the equivalent of 250,000 machines without storage).\n",
        "\n",
        "If we store through elevating water, here is a hint on the scale of what is required: in France, dams produce today 7% of the total electricity consumed (and represent 20% of the installed production power). It means that having enough water stored to supply the whole France when there is no wind requires to multiply dam lakes by 5 to 6 at least (so that dams alone can provide France with 100% of its peak consumption), then have the same surface of lakes downstream to recuperate the water after it is turbined to put it back in the upstram reservoir. We should also take into account the energy losses linked to the friction when elevating water back in upstream reservoirs (with the electricity delivered by wind turbines on windy days, which is roughly 25%).\"\"\",\n",
